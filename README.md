WEATHER PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Problem Description:
The goal is to predict weather conditions based on historical data and various meteorological features. 

Approach:
Weather prediction is a Regression problem .
For a regression problem like weather prediction, labelled data with actual weather measurements is crucial for training the model.
Machine Learning Algorithms:
Supervised Learning Algorithms
Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
Supervised learning is a technique where a model learns from labelled data to make predictions or classifications. 
In the context of weather and climate forecasting, supervised learning can be used for tasks such as predicting the temperature or precipitation for a given location and time.

Data Source:
The Data used here is obtained from an open source Kaggle â€“ Historical Weather Data for Indian Cities.
There are different methods of foreseeing temperature utilizing Regression and a variety of Functional Regression, in which datasets are utilized. 
To Train, the calculations 80% size of dataset information is utilized and 20% size of information is named as a Test set.
The temperature prediction of Bengaluru city with the help of various machine learning algorithms and various regressions.Predicting the temperature by applying various regressions on the historical weather dataset of Bengaluru city.
Applying Multiple Linear regression, then Decision Tree regression, and Random Forest Regression.

Decision Tree Regression

Decision Tree Regression model has medium mean absolute error. It will be little accurate model.This may produce better results than Multiple Linear Regression.
